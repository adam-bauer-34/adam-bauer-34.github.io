Here is a (very) brief overview of my professional life until now, starting with my undergraduate career at the University of Arizona, and finishing with my current status as a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. To check out my CV, see the sidebar. 

# Undergraduate studies

I attended the University of Arizona (UArizona) for undergrad in the beautiful Tucson desert. (For as much [slander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5IsoelUMF0) as Tucson gets in the media, I loved actually it there.) At UArizona, I majored in physics and mathematics, minored in astronomy and astrophysics, and was involved in numerous research efforts in a variety of topics. Brief summaries are given below — see my CV for complete list of project goals and outcomes.

My first group was supervised by [Prof. Brenda Frye](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye) , Professor of astronomy at Steward Observatory. We studied the gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters using observational data, mainly spectroscopic and photometric. 

My second advisor was [Prof. Paul Carter](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~pcarter/index.html), Professor of mathematics now at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Together we proved the existence of transonic stellar wind solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, including viscosity and head conduction, totally rigorously using geometric singular perturbation theory. This was a highly enjoyable project. 

My third & final advisor at UArizona was [Prof. Sam Gralla](http://u.arizona.edu/~sgralla/). We worked on exploring the Aretakis instability near the inner horizon of black holes. 

# Graduate studies 

I’m currently a second year graduate student at the Univeristy of Illinois Urbana Champaign, working in two different groups on two *very* different projects. I haven’t yet decided which group I will work with for my Ph. D. (though I will have to very soon), but for now I’m enjoying the tightrope I walk between these projects.

In one project I am co-advised
