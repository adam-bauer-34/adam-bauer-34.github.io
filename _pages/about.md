Hi! I'm Adam, an NSF graduate research fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I am advised by Cristi Proistosescu, Principle Investigator of the [Climate dynamics and data science @ UIUC research group](https://cdds-at-uiuc.github.io). My work primarily focuses on problems in climate science and climate economics, though recently I've been shifting my focus more and more to the economics/policy component. [Check out my CV if you want more information on my research and academic background.](https://www.ambauer.com/files/cv/Bauer_CV.pdf)

I am a trained theoretical physicist and mathematician who now focuses on more "practical" problems (than, say, [the spacetime near a ray of light](https://www.ambauer.com/project/null-rays-penrose)). The tools I've developed during my research career are considerably diverse; I've completed projects that involve [theorem-proof style mathematics](https://www.ambauer.com/project/solar-wind), [designing a computational asset pricing model for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions](https://www.ambauer.com/project/risk-cost-of-carbon), and [building models to interpret climate data](https://www.ambauer.com/project/heat-waves). I hope to continue doing research in my career after graduation at a non-profit "think tank" or in the private sector. 

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona (UArizona), where I graduated with a B.S. in physics (_with honors_) and a B.S. in mathematics, along with a minor in astronomy and astrophysics. I worked on numerous projects during my undergraduate years, including projects related to understanding massive galaxy clusters, the fluid mechanics of the solar wind, and the inner horizon(s) of black holes. I won the Excellence in Undergraduate Research Award from the UArizona College of Science for my contributions to each of these fields.

  <em>Out of all the things I did in undergrad, making friends was by far the most important.</em>

I grew up in Buffalo, New York, an upbringing that prepared me well for the cold midwestern winters. In my spare time, I rock climb. A lot. I also play chess (poorly) and try to study it as often as I can. I enjoy reading, especially books on history, economics, and philosophy, as well as really, really corny self-help books. [(Check out my book reviews if you'd like to learn more.)](https://www.ambauer.com/tags/?tag=book-review) I also listen to way too many podcasts and music across a variety of genres. I also love sports and live and die by the Buffalo Bills.
