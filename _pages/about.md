Here is a (very) brief overview of my professional involvements until now. First are my research efforts, listed in reverse chronological order. Second is a summary of the outreach programs I’ve been a part of. For a full description of my academic activities, check out my CV in the sidebar.

# Research Activities

## Graduate studies 

I’m currently a second year physics graduate student at the Univeristy of Illinois Urbana Champaign, working in two different groups on two *very* different projects. I haven’t yet decided which group I will work with for my Ph. D. (though I will have to very soon), but for now I’m enjoying the tightrope I walk between these projects.

In one project I am co-advised by [Prof. Nico Yunes](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/nyunes) and [Prof. Charles Gammie](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/gammie) (with great support from graduate student [Alejandro Cardenas-Avendano](https://alejandroc137.bitbucket.io/)). Currently, we are trying to ascertain if the Event Horizon Telescope can be used to test general relativity against modified gravity theories.

In my other project I am advised by [Prof. Cristi Proistosescu](https://cristi.web.illinois.edu/), where we are exploring two important themes related to climate change. First, we are working to understand the arisal of heat waves and the basic physical mechanisms that lead to their occurance. Secondly, we are collaborating with [Prof. Gernot Wagner](gwagner.com) to improve our understanding of the economic implications of climate change by upgrading the climate module in Gernot’s climate-economic program, [EZClimate](https://github.com/Litterman/EZClimate).

Like I said, very different projects.

## Undergraduate studies

I attended the University of Arizona (UArizona) for undergrad in the beautiful Tucson desert. (For as much [slander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5IsoelUMF0) as Tucson gets in the media, I actually loved it there.) At UArizona, I majored in physics and mathematics, minored in astronomy and astrophysics, and was involved in numerous research efforts in a variety of topics, all related in one way or another to astrophysics.

My first group was supervised by [Prof. Brenda Frye](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye), Professor of astronomy at Steward Observatory. We studied the gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters using observational data, mainly spectroscopic and photometric. 

My second advisor was [Prof. Paul Carter](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~pcarter/index.html), Professor of mathematics now at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Together we proved the existence of transonic stellar wind solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, including viscosity and head conduction, totally rigorously using geometric singular perturbation theory. This was a highly enjoyable project. 

My third & final advisor at UArizona was [Prof. Sam Gralla](http://u.arizona.edu/~sgralla/). We worked on exploring the Aretakis instability near the inner horizon of black holes.

# Outreach Activities

In addition to my research pursuits, I am committed to creating a more inclusive and inviting environment for underrepresented groups in physics. I’ve primarily demonstrated this through volunteering and mentoring.

While at UArizona, I worked in the [Physics Discovery](https://flandrau.org/discoveries) program as both an instructor and as a project developer. The goal of this program was to give disadvantaged K-12 students exposure to science that they would otherwise not have. As an instructor, I gave small, hands-on physics lessons to local Tucson K-12 students. As a project manager, I built a set of demonstrations that showcased modern physics — such as the wave-particle duality and radioactivity — that has since been implemented in the program. 

Also at UArizona, I was a peer mentor in the Department of Astronomy. I mentored multiple students, helping them find research work and navigate the whirlwind of college life. I was especially proud that one of my students  was awarded a NASA/UArizona Space Grant Fellowship to fund his research efforts.

The COVID-19 pandemic limited my outreach opportunities since arriving at UIUC, but I’m looking forward to getting more involved in outreach in the Fall 2021 semester.
