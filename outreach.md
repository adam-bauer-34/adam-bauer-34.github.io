title: Outreach involvement
---

Aside from my research interests, I’ve also been involved in numerous outreach programs with the goal to *recruit* and *retain* more individuals in science, regardless of their background. The hope is that, through these programs, we create a more inclusive and diverse science community. 

I am also more than happy to present science to a public audience — please contact me with any such opportunities! 

## Science outreach
While at the University of Arizona (UArizona), I worked in the [Physics Discovery](https://flandrau.org/discoveries) program as both an instructor and as a project developer. The goal of this program was to give disadvantaged K-12 students exposure to science that they would otherwise not have. As an instructor, I gave small, hands-on physics lessons to local Tucson K-12 students. As a project manager, I built a set of demonstrations that showcased modern physics — such as the wave-particle duality and radioactivity — that has since been implemented in the program. 

## Mentoring
Also at UArizona, I was a peer mentor in the Department of Astronomy. I mentored multiple students, helping them find research work and navigate the whirlwind of college life. I was especially proud that one of my students  was awarded a NASA/UArizona Space Grant Fellowship to fund his research efforts.

I continuted this mentoring work by joining the Graduate Peer Mentors at UIUC. I’ve worked in this program for the past two years, and I have mentored two undergraduate students thus far. My main responsibilities have been to help them navigate department resources and get them involved in research. I’m hoping to continue my role in this organization throughout graduate school. 

## Education reform 
I have also focused on reforming STEM education by developing assignments to mitigate the impact of test anxiety on student evaluation. The American Test Anxieties Association estimates that approximately 16%—20% of students experience high test anxiety; moreover, these students tend to score twelve percentiles lower than their low test anxiety peers. These data, along with my own personal struggles with test anxiety, led me to brainstorm ways for students with test anxiety to showcase their talent in a non-exam environment. 

With this in mind, I developed a new assignment for upper division science classes: the Analytic Formal Report (AFR). An AFR is written in a similar tone as an academic paper, and is graded on the *validity* and *thoroughness* of a student’s solution to a challenging problem. I partnered with Prof. Shawn Jackson, professor of physics at UA, to implement this assignment in his class in spring 2020, making a student’s cumulative score on AFRs worth 12.5% of the final grade; this 12.5% was taken away from the weight of student exam performance. 

We found that more than 80% of students preferred the AFR to conventional problem sets, and moreover, a similar number of students thought the AFRs “significantly developed” them as scientific writers. The assignment was such a success that Prof. Jackson invited me to implement the AFR again the following year, where I oversaw its implementation virtually. We again saw success, and are hoping to make the assignment a permanent component of Prof. Jackson’s courses going forward.
