These are my notes on the book *Atmospheric science*, by Wallace and Hobbs. I am attempting to self-teach myself atmospheric science out of this book, so I’ve decided to take some detailed notes and make them public on my website. Please excuse any typos throughout, and let me know if you find any. 

The structure of these notes follows the structure of the book, with an additional “Dictionary” section added in the beginning so that I (you) can easily reference terms that are unfamiliar to me (you). These are organized in alphebetical order.
