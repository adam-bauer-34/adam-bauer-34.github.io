In April 2022, I was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My proposal outlined a project to explore the controls on heat waves using conceptual (or “phenomenological”) models. I applied under the subarea of “Physics and Astronomy - Other (specify)”, which I filled in as “Climate physics”. 

I was also awarded with an honorable mention for the award in the 2020 cycle. My proposal here outlined a plan to explore the heating mechanisms behind the solar wind. I applied under the “Physics and astronomy - astronomy and astrophysics” subarea for this application. 

Below are my application materials for both cycles, as well as my reviewer comments for the 2022 application cycle. (Apparently I was too jaded about the award result in 2020 to save the reviewer comments… what do they know anyways?) Feel free to use these as reference!
