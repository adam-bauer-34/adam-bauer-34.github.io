These are my notes on the book *Atmospheric science*, by Wallace and Hobbs. I am attempting to self-teach myself atmospheric science out of this book, so I’ve decided to take some detailed notes and make them public on my website. Please excuse any typos throughout, and let me know if you find any. 

The structure of these notes follows the structure of the book, with an additional “Dictionary” section added in the beginning so that I (you) can easily reference terms that are unfamiliar to me (you). These are organized in alphebetical order. 

# Dictionary 

**Convection**: the process by which relatively hot fluid (and thus, less dense fluid) rises and thus causes relatively cold fluid to sink.

**Gyres**: A circular ocean flow caused from cyclonic wind systems 

**Zonal mean**: Mean along lines of latitude 

# Chapter 2: The Earth system

## 2.1: Components of the Earth system

Major players in the Earth’s climate system: 
- *Atmospheric radiation and convection*: regulates temperature at the Earth’s surface, sets limits on snow and ice cover 
- *Stratospheric ozone*: protects biosphere from UV radiation
- *Wind*: Regulates patterns of oceanic upwelling; determines the distribution of water that sustains the terrestrial biosphere; transports gas, spores, seeds, smoke and other lightweight things (like undergraduate alcohol tolerance) over long distances.
- *Rain, frost, wind*: erodes the Earth’s crust, wears down mountains and reshapes landscape 
- *Ocean*: large “thermal inertia”; major player in carbon cycle
- *Snow and ice*: Increases Earth albedo, thus reflecting more incoming solar radiation (which has a further cooling effect) 
- *Plants*: by recycling water into the atmosphere through their leaves, plants play a big role in summertime climate through their impact on humidity
- *Plate tectonics*: causes volcanic eruptions, mountain shaping, and continental drift (on very long timescales, of course)

### 2.1.1: Oceans 

The mass of the ocean is 250x that of the atmosphere :o.

#### (a) Composition and vertical structure

The density of sea water is linearly dependent on the concentration of dissolved salt, i.e., &sigma; &sim; *s*, if *s* is the salinity (i.e., concentration of dissovled salt). The density of the ocean, &sigma;, is a complicated function of temperature, but not a strong function of pressure, such that &sigma; = &sigma;(T,s). 

Because ocean water is saline, the temperature dependence of density is different than pure water. For fresh water, density increases as temperature increases between T = 0 C and T = 4 C, whereas in ocean water density monatonically decreases with temperature for all T. This causes ice to float in ocean water, because ice is less dense than sea water.

The ocean has an upper *mixed layer,* which is mixed by wind and has a slightly lower density than the layers beneath it. Then there is the *pynocline*, which locates much of the density gradient in the ocean. This density gradient **inhibits vertical mixing**, much like the temperature gradient in the tropopause inhibits vertical mixing between the troposphere and stratosphere. (This is why ozone doesn’t become uniformly distributed in the troposphere.)

Water parcels that aren’t in contact with the surface tend to conserve salinity and temperature over long distances, so we can track where water comes from using these properties. Some noteable regions of the ocean are:
- *Mediterranean outflow*: warm and salty water 
- *North Atlantic deep water (NADW)*
- *Antarctic bottom water (AABW)*

#### (b) The ocean circulation

Two components: *thermohaline* and *wind-driven*. 

Wind-driven dominates the upper ocean layer, whereas the deep ocean circulation is dominated by the thermohaline.

##### The wind-driven component 
- Transfers horizontal momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean via drag 
- By generating ocean waves, momentum gets transfered downward 
- Noteable feature: the west-to-east *Antarctic circumpolar current*

##### The thermohaline component
- Deep water circulation
- Warm surface water travels northward and hits the polar region; sinks and becomes a deepwater current  that upwells as it travels south
- The major sinking regions of warm water are in Antarctica and off the coast of Greenland 
- See Fig. 2.7 on page 29 for a schematic 

#### (c) The marine biosphere
Most sunlight gets absorbed in the first few hundred meters of water — denoted as the *euphotic zone* — this is where most of the life in the ocean resides. This life uses carbon and makes oxygen, generally. This causes the water in the uppermost layer of the ocean to be carbon depleted and oxygen rich. Hence, ocean life tends to be present in areas where there is an upwelling of deep ocean water, as it is the most carbon rich water in this sector of the ocean. (Upwelling in the ocean is generally in regions where the SSTs are anomalously cold.)

#### (d) Sea surface temperature 
The patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) is controlled by wind and radiation. 

Radiation causes a strong temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles. 

Wind causes zonal SST anomalies, as wind drags warm water west in the tropics and east in the mid-to-high latitudes. 

The local SSTs feedback on the atmosphere; dry regions (like the Sahara desert and the American southwest) are dry because they are located near *cold tounges* of the ocean.
