I spearheaded a set of comments on the Federal Reserve's new "Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Mangaement for Large Financial Institutions" (Docket No. OP--1793) along with some close collaborators. The upshot: large financial institutions should absolutely take into account climate-related risk, but they should be especially careful (i) to properly downscale climate models, and (ii) to fully integrate over all sources of risk in the climate-economic system.
