These are my notes on the book *Atmospheric science*, by Wallace and Hobbs. I am attempting to self-teach myself atmospheric science out of this book, so I’ve decided to take some detailed notes and make them public on my website. Please excuse any typos throughout, and let me know if you find any. 

The structure of these notes follows the structure of the book, with an additional “Dictionary” section added in the beginning so that I (you) can easily reference terms that are unfamiliar to me (you). These are organized in alphebetical order. 

# Dictionary 

**Convection**: the process by which relatively hot fluid (and thus, less dense fluid) rises and thus causes relatively cold fluid to sink.

**Gyres**: A circular ocean flow caused from cyclonic wind systems 

**Zonal mean**: Mean along lines of latitude 

**Residence time**: mass divided by the *efflux*

**Efflux**: the rate at which a given substance exits a reservior; an outgoing flux of material 

# Chapter 2: The Earth system 

## 2.1: Components of the Earth system 

Major players in the Earth’s climate system: 
- *Atmospheric radiation and convection*: regulates temperature at the Earth’s surface, sets limits on snow and ice cover 
- *Stratospheric ozone*: protects biosphere from UV radiation
- *Wind*: Regulates patterns of oceanic upwelling; determines the distribution of water that sustains the terrestrial biosphere; transports gas, spores, seeds, smoke and other lightweight things (like undergraduate alcohol tolerance) over long distances.
- *Rain, frost, wind*: erodes the Earth’s crust, wears down mountains and reshapes landscape 
- *Ocean*: large “thermal inertia”; major player in carbon cycle
- *Snow and ice*: Increases Earth albedo, thus reflecting more incoming solar radiation (which has a further cooling effect) 
- *Plants*: by recycling water into the atmosphere through their leaves, plants play a big role in summertime climate through their impact on humidity
- *Plate tectonics*: causes volcanic eruptions, mountain shaping, and continental drift (on very long timescales, of course)

### 2.1.1: Oceans 

The mass of the ocean is 250x that of the atmosphere :o.

#### (a) Composition and vertical structure

The density of sea water, &sigma;, is linearly dependent on the concentration of dissolved salt, i.e., &sigma; &sim; *s*, if *s* is the salinity (i.e., concentration of dissovled salt). The density of the ocean, &sigma;, is a complicated function of temperature, but not a strong function of pressure, such that &sigma; = &sigma;(T,s). 

Because ocean water is saline, the temperature dependence of density is different than pure water. For fresh water, density increases as temperature increases between T = 0 &deg;C and T = 4 &deg;C, whereas in ocean water density monatonically decreases with temperature for all T. This causes ice to float in ocean water, because ice is less dense than sea water.

The ocean has an upper *mixed layer,* which is mixed by wind and has a slightly lower density than the layers beneath it. Then there is the *pynocline*, which locates much of the density gradient in the ocean. This density gradient **inhibits vertical mixing**, much like the temperature gradient in the tropopause inhibits vertical mixing between the troposphere and stratosphere. (This is why ozone doesn’t become uniformly distributed in the troposphere.)

Water parcels that aren’t in contact with the surface tend to conserve salinity and temperature over long distances, so we can track where water comes from using these properties. Some noteable regions of the ocean are:
- *Mediterranean outflow*: warm and salty water 
- *North Atlantic deep water (NADW)*
- *Antarctic bottom water (AABW)*

#### (b) The ocean circulation

Two components: *thermohaline* and *wind-driven*. 

Wind-driven dominates the upper ocean layer, whereas the deep ocean circulation is dominated by the thermohaline.

##### The wind-driven component 
- Transfers horizontal momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean via drag 
- By generating ocean waves, momentum gets transfered downward 
- Noteable feature: the west-to-east *Antarctic circumpolar current*

##### The thermohaline component
- Deep water circulation
- Warm surface water travels northward and hits the polar region; sinks and becomes a deepwater current  that upwells as it travels south
- The major sinking regions of warm water are in Antarctica and off the coast of Greenland 
- See Fig. 2.7 on page 29 for a schematic 

#### (c) The marine biosphere
Most sunlight gets absorbed in the first few hundred meters of water — denoted as the *euphotic zone* — this is where most of the life in the ocean resides. This life uses carbon and makes oxygen, generally. This causes the water in the uppermost layer of the ocean to be carbon depleted and oxygen rich. Hence, ocean life tends to be present in areas where there is an upwelling of deep ocean water, as it is the most carbon rich water in this sector of the ocean. (Upwelling in the ocean is generally in regions where the SSTs are anomalously cold.)

#### (d) Sea surface temperature 
The patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) is controlled by wind and radiation. 

Radiation causes a strong temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles. 

Wind causes zonal SST anomalies, as wind drags warm water west in the tropics and east in the mid-to-high latitudes. 

The local SSTs feedback on the atmosphere; dry regions (like the Sahara desert and the American southwest) are dry because they are located near *cold tounges* of the ocean. 

### 2.1.2: The cryosphere 

The crysophere refers to parts of the Earth system where water is in its solid form, i.e., snow and ice.

This system contributes to the thermal inertia via
- *Albedo*: by reflecting solar radiation 
- Influencing thermohaline circulation by feeding the ocean with fresh (low salinity) water 

Antarctica and Greenland (coined *continental ice sheets*) are the largest contributors to the cryosphere.

*How ice sheets form*: Snow falls onto the ice sheet; more snow falls, compressing the existing snow into ice; as yet more snow falls, the pressure causes the ice to spread out horizontally and shrink vertically.

*Sea ice* covers more area on Earth than the continental ice sheets, but is comparitively thin. The field of sea ice is more of a fractal than a continuous sheet, with individual components being dragged by wind. 

The annual mean sea ice motion is dominated by the *Beaufort gyre* to the north of Alaska and the *transpolar drift stream* from Siberia towards Greenland.

When water freezes into new ice, it rejects the salt that was previously dissolved in it. This creates a *brine* of unusually high salinity sea water, which causes average salinity sea water to sink (hence causing the thermohaline circulation at the poles). This is why the main areas of water sinking is near ice sheets.

The last member of the cryosphere (discussed here) is *permafrost*. This is permanently frozen soil (>2 years) and is hugely important for influencing terrestrial ecology. The permafrost closely follows the 0 &deg;C annual mean isotherm, but does slightly extend beneath it due to seasonal snow insulation.

### 2.1.3: The terrestrial biosphere

The terrestrial biosphere is largely divided up into *biomes*, which comprise of distinct collections of plants and animals. Which biome one resides in depends on 
- annual-mean temperature
- annual and diurnal temperature ranges
- annual-mean precipitation 
- the seasonal distributions of precipitation and cloudiness 

The biosphere feeds back on the atmosphere in a variety of ways:
- *The hydrologic cycle*: In the summer when plants are abundant, incoming solar radiation gets used to (1) evaporate water and (2) fuel photosynthesis (which results in water being put into the atmosphere). In these cases, the energy is put into the atmosphere (through the water vapor) without heating the surface (i.e., is injected as a latent heat flux rather than a sensible heat flux). This is why grass covered areas are cooler than pavement.
- *Local albedo*: snow relfects sunlight
- *Roughness of land surface*: inhibits or enables high wind speed

### 2.1.4: The Earth’s crust and mantle 

The layout of Earth’s mountains, oceans and continents are primarily a result of *plate tectonics* and *continental drift*. 

Ocean plates colliding with continental plates causes ocean plates to be *subducted* (i.e., sucked underneath the continental plate) because the ocean plates are less dense. The ocean plate then becomes part of the mantle. The ocean plate is replenished where the mantle upwells into the ocean and cools, i.e., along the mid-Atlantic ridge.

Collisions between plate boundaries cause volcanic activity, earthquakes, and mountain ranges.

### 2.1.5: Roles of various components of the Earth system in climate

The various atmosphere, geologic, oceanic and biospheric (?) processes described above all **feedback** on the climate system. The concept of a feedback is important in climate science and is used to characterize the impact of various processes on the global climate system. This will be the topic of future discussion.

## 2.2: The hydrologic cycle 

A lot of the biosphere depends on the hydrologic cycle, i.e., the cycling of water between reserviors. Useful when discussing this topic is the concept of *residence time*, which indicates how long a given water (or substance, generally) parcel remains in a reservior. 

The Earth’s mantle is the largest water reservior in the hydrologic cycle, followed by the oceans and continental ice sheets.

# Cool stuff

This section is reserved for those bits of science that make you go “woah, that’s really freaking cool.”

- The theory of continental drift, first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, was rejected until the 1960s until magnetic fields from the ocean floor could be detected to confirm the formation of new tectonic plates (that cause drift).
- The transpolar drift stream was discovered by sailing an empty ship from Siberia to Greenland [i.e., across the North Pole!] whose mast could withstand the pressue of freezing. The ship was called *Forward*, and resulted in the official discovery of the transpolar drift stream. The original thought to do this was after the discovery that a shipwreck in Siberia ended up in Greenland ~5 years after it was lost! 
- Given the amount of water in the Earth’s mantle (~2 x 10<sup>7<\sup> kg m<sup>-2<\sup>) and it’s efflux (~ 2 x 10<sup>-4<\sup> kg m<sup>-2<\sup> year<sup>-1<\sup>), the amount of water that’s been extracted from the mantle over the course of the Earth’s lifetime (~4.5 x 10<sup>9<\sup> years) is not enough to fill the oceans! 

To be continued :)
