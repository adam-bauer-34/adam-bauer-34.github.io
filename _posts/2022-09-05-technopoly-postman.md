title: A review of "Technopoly - The surrender of culture to technology" by Neil Postman
description: Mr. Postman, in his unmistakably direct, eeirily profound, and occasionally sarcastic way, foretells of a society where technology dictates culture to consumers. And it's hard to say he's wrong.

Have you ever wondered why technology seems to, in some real sense, rule our lives? Technology — and most importantly, the internet, grand marshal of the technology parade — has permeated our culture to almost an unfathomable degree. From TikTok stars dictating fashion trends, to therapy podcasts giving out “quick fixes” to intergenerational trauma, to pornstars giving sex advice to married couples (think about that one for a minute), almost all of our information comes from the technology we hold in our hands, put in our packets, and watch on our screens.

It’s puzzling to think how we got here. Or maybe you’ve never even sat down to think about it. The internet was invented in 1983, and just forty years later, it’s _the_ dominant cultural force of our lifetimes. Move over, American presidents, philosophers, and rock stars… that is, unless you have a serious social media presence.

Neil Postman, in _Technopoly: The surrender of culture to technology_, attempts to tackle the causal chain of technology taking over culture. He breaks down the causal chain into three components. First, technology is a tool. As tools permeate society, society becomes a technocracy: a co-evolving body with technology feeding back on society and its values, but not necessarily dominating it. The final stage bears the title of the book: technopoly, where technology dictates culture to its servants.

Establishing such a causal chain requires serious historical scope and nuance, both of which are abundant in _Technopoly_. But what makes this work so impactful, for me, was that _Technopoly_ was written in **1992**! The “technology” that Mr. Postman talks about is _television_, an incredibly “primitive” technology relative to the internet. (Until very recently, I didn’t own a television in my apartment. Who needs a TV if you have a laptop?)

I imagine at the time Mr. Postman was written off as a kook, an over-worried “boomer” (to borrow a phrase) that needs to just shut up, move aside, and embrace the golden age of technological development.

Yet, read today, _Technopoly_ reads like a prophecy of what would come in the twenty-first century. 

Take for example one of the central ideas in the book: that completing a task using technology feeds back on the _very idea_ of the task in the first place. Before I can illustrate this point more clearly, a brief aside on computer optimization problems is warranted.

When computers are asked to “find the best” of something, they tend to do so by “optimizing” (i.e., by finding the highest possible value of) what’s called an “objective function.” The “objective function” has some number of inputs, and the inputs that optimize the “objective function” are the “optimal” inputs.

To illustrate this point, think about nutrition, and more specifically diet (this removes the exercise “variable” from nutrition problem). In this case, your overall health is the “objective function.” If you asked a computer to “optimize” nutrition for you, it’d derive, based on some set of preferences (are you trying to gain muscle or lose weight?) the optimal protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake. So, in principle, if you eat those amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, you’d be a very healthy individual. 

This obviously comes with limitations, but the underlying idea is the key bit: if you give a computer a problem to solve, it will (1) define an objective function in terms of some inputs and (2) find the set of inputs that results in the maximum of the objective function. 

With this framework in mind, we can now illustrate Mr. Postman’s thesis with an example: dating in the modern age. 

But first, an anecdote! When I arrived in New York City for a semester-long stay at Columbia Business School, I met a young actress who had just made her debut on a Hulu show, and over drinks and pizza we got to talking about dating (alas, it was not talk of _us_ dating). 

“There are a lot of young, beautiful women in NYC that are looking for partners,” she told me. Wide-eyed, I asked her, “What would I do to meet them?” 

> Download _Hinge_ and get to work. 
was her response.

Dating in the modern age is practically indivisible from dating apps. On its own, one might argue, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. How else would you find as many possible singles in your immediate vicinity and try to go on dates with the best of them?

But this very question is exactly Postman’s point: if you use dating apps to date, you’re essentially viewing dating _as a computer would_; that is, as an optimization problem, where the very idea of dating is to optimize your dating “preferences,” or in other words, your dating “objective function.” The inputs? Income, beauty, sex appeal, number of children desired, religious convictions, political leanings, vaccination status… the list as endless as it is varied for the user.

Mr. Postman resoundingly concludes this “computer-fication” of our very ideas is a bad thing, and that we should responsibly consider this dynamic whenever new technology enters the fray. I would be much more inclined to agree with the latter than the former. It’s hard to argue against being aware of this dynamic in our lives; i.e., don’t let pornography become your idea of real-life sex, don’t let instagram become your idea of real-life approval and popularity, don’t let Reddit become you idea of real-life community. But that it is on the whole bad requires a bit more careful thought than I think Mr. Postman is prepared to provide.

I admit, I am in the bag for Mr. Postman’s writing. I am a proud technology skeptic — I have no social media presence, with my only online presence being this website (comments turned off, thank you very much), and don’t even have an internet browser on my phone — so Mr. Postman patting my skepticism on the back triggers some deep confirmation bias for me. But despite this, I still would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in figuring out why the hell the internet is so influential in culture, and especially how it feedbacks on our ideas in the first place.

**Rating**: The optimal input to any tech-skeptic’s “tell me why technology should be treated with the utmost caution” objective function. 

**Pok&eacute;mon card for this book**: I thought the Lost City card fit for _Technopoly_ because Mr. Postman argues, at least in part, that we’re a bit lost as a society. So it fits quite well.
