I’m happy to collaborate on a wide variety of projects related to climate physics (and otherwise). If you’d like to reach me, email is likely the best way. I also have an office in the Natural History Building on the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign campus, but I am hardly there because, frankly, parking on this campus is a disaster.
