I’m happy to collaborate on a wide variety of projects related to climate physics (and otherwise). If you’d like to reach me, email is likely the best way. I also have an office in the Natural History Building on the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign campus, and am around M—F from ~8 AM — 5 PM. Always happy to grab a cup of coffee and chat. 

**Email:** adammb4 [at] illinois [dot] edu

**Office:** Natural History Building, Rm 4050, Office A, 1301 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801
