Here is a (very) brief overview of my life until now. Don’t worry — if you skip over this page, you won’t be missing much. I’m not that interesting. 

# Early Life

I grew up in Depew, a small town in upstate New York, originally formed to house all of the steelworkers at the famous Bethlehem steel plant. Now, it’s a tiny subsection of the broader suburban landscape on the outskirts of Buffalo, New York, and houses mainly middle class workers (nurses, etc.) and a surprisingly high number of construction workers. 

My family is very central to my life, which consists of my parents, Anne Marie and Mike, and my siblings, Elizabeth, Andrew, and Mary Grace. To only list these names would be misleading, as we frequently have events with all of the aunts and uncles involved. However, I wont’ list them all here. It’d take too much space.

I went to Depew High School, home of the Wildcats, where I got my high school degree. Here I also played sports (football, hockey, lacrosse, baseball, wrestling) and particiapted in the school musicals (both as talent as as lighting crew). These were very formative years for me, for better or for worse. Coming out of high school I wanted to be an astronomer/astrophysicist, after some flirtation with neuroscience. I ended up going the astronomy route. This was for the best.

# Undergraduate years

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona. For as much [slander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5IsoelUMF0) as Tucson gets in the media, I actually loved it there. At first I triple majored in astronomy, physics and mathematics, but over time I shaved off the astronomy major and settled on double majoring in physics and mathematics. (Although, these two majors have a lot of crossover, so it’s not that impressive that I managed this. I promise.) 

This was, quite possibly, the best decision of my life. I met some of my closest friends here, learned numerous valuable lessons (the hard way, mostly) and became deeply involved in the long road of self-actualization and discovery. Oh, and I also got considerable better than average at a 2001 children’s party game, Super Smash Bros Melee, and discovered my passion for rock climbing. Obviously, these things are far more important than any amount of self-actualization I’ll ever accomplish.

# Graduate years
I accepted an offer to become a Ph.D. student in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in March 2020, and moved to Champaign-Urbana (CU) in August 2020. After a bit of an adjustment period, I’ve gotten used to life in CU, and enjoy it. For the most part. (Admittedly, I was spoiled to hell with beautiful weather and ample climbing areas in Tucson, so not having these now still saddens me.) 

I bounced around research groups before landing with Prof. Cristi Proistosescu in climate science. I decided to work in climate because I wanted my work have real impact on the problems I was witnessing in the world, rather than work on research for “discovery’s sake.” That is not to say this approach is not justified; I think it’s important that we have folks who pursue things like art and science without necessarily demanding their research “apply” to society in any particular way. This just wasn’t satisfying for me — I wanted to have an impact, especially on a cause as important as climate change. 

To be continued, whenever more interesting things happen in my life…..
