My research interests lie in the intersection of dynamical systems and climate physics. I give more extensive descriptions of my projects and techniques below, as well as a list of publications. *If you cannot access any of the publications listed, please email me and I’d be happy to provide a copy.* Lastly, I list some former projects I was involved in where I focused on astrophysics. 

# Climate physics projects

Here are two projects that I’m currently involved with in the field of climate physics and climate economics. Both of these projects are collaborations with my advisor, [Prof. Cristi Proistosescu](https://cristi.web.illinois.edu/).

### The physics of extreme heating events 
We are working to understand the arisal and persistance of heat waves with [Dr. Lucas Vargas-Zeppetello](https://vargaszeppetello.weebly.com/). Using a conceptual model originally formulated by Lucas, I’ve derived a 1D Hasselmann-like model for soil moisture dynamics with a analytically tractible nonlinearity. The strength of this model is that it decouples the temperature and moisture dynamics near the surface. We intend to use this model to explore the moments of soil moisture near the surface when forced with stochastic precipitation, and map the moisture moments to temperature moments.  This in turn will enable us to understand how the tails of the temperature PDF evolve in a warming planet, hence giving us an understanding of extreme heating events. 

### The cost of climate change 
Secondly, we are collaborating with [Prof. Gernot Wagner](gwagner.com) to improve our understanding of the economic implications of climate change by upgrading the climate module in Gernot’s climate-economic program, [EZClimate](https://github.com/Litterman/EZClimate). We use a two-box climate emulator to capture the multiple timescales in climate warming that is neglected by most (if not all) climate-economic models. This project will result in an updated cost of carbon which can be of use to policymakers as laws such as carbon taxes are drafted. 

# Research techniques

As stated above, my Ph. D. is focused on studying the Earth’s climate and how it evolves as the Earth warms. Below I outline the ways I approach the problems I tackle in climate physics.

### Nonlinear dynamical systems

Much of the interesting processes found in nature — such as waves, pattern formation, and feedback amplification — are dynamical processes that evolve in time and space. Mathematically, these systems boil down to systems of differential equations, often made more complicatied by nonlinearities and coupling of variables. I am continuously fascinated by such systems, and the various ways we can analyze them. 

The two primary ways I tend to approach dynamical systems reseach is through rigorous analytic techniques and simulations. Analytic techniques, such as timescale analysis, perturbation theory, canard theory and others, are powerful tools that can enable us to glean the underlying dynamics of often incredibly complicated systems. On the other hand, I tend to use simulations to *inform* and *verify* our analyic approximations, as well as conduct preliminary analysis of our system before any analytics are done. Combining these two approaches often leads to fruitful, fascinating results. 

### Data science 

What’s the point of theory if it doesn’t hold in the real world? The wealth of observational, simulation, and reanalysis data available to the climate science community allows us to conduct a litany of interesting science and discover correlations between seemingly uncorrelated physical events. This sector of my research toolkit is very much in its infancy, but I’m looking forward to develop it in the future.

# Past projects

**I no longer work in these fields. This section just serves as a bit of an “archive” for former projects.**

All of the projects below are focused on astrophysics. 

My first astrophysics project was supervised by [Prof. Brenda Frye](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye), Professor of astronomy at Steward Observatory. We studied the gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters using observational data, mainly spectroscopic and photometric. I coauthored two papers while a member of this group.

My second advisor was [Prof. Paul Carter](https://www.math.uci.edu/~pacarter/), Professor of mathematics now at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Together we proved the existence of transonic stellar wind solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, including viscosity and head conduction, totally rigorously using geometric singular perturbation theory. This was a highly enjoyable project, and led to my first lead-authored publication.

My third & final advisor at UArizona was [Prof. Sam Gralla](http://u.arizona.edu/~sgralla/). We worked on exploring the Aretakis instability near the inner horizon of black holes. This work resulted in my senior thesis.

My final project was co-advised by [Prof. Nico Yunes](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/nyunes) and [Prof. Charles Gammie](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/gammie) (with great support from Dr. [Alejandro Cardenas-Avendano](https://alejandroc137.bitbucket.io/)). We used numerical and analytic models to ascertain that the Event Horizon Telescope can be used to test general relativity against modified gravity theories given sufficiently well-understood astrophysical modeling. I first authored a manuscript on the results of this project that has been published in *The Astrophysical Journal*.
