title: Research interests
---

I have been involved in numerous different research efforts in my career. I am currently pursuing a Ph. D. in physics with a focus in climate and atmospheric physics; prior to this work, I devoted much of my attention to research in astrophysics. Below I describe my broad interests, as well as the many projects I’ve been involved with. 

# Research interests 

As stated above, my Ph. D. is focused on studying the Earth’s climate and how it evolves as the Earth warms. Below I outline my general interests, which I then apply specifically to climate physics in the following section. 

## Dynamical systems

Much of the interesting processes found in nature — such as waves, pattern formation, and feedbacks — are dynamical processes that evolve in time and space. Mathematically, these systems boil down to systems of differential equations, often nonlinear and coupled. I am continuously fascinated by such systems, and the various ways we can analyze them. 

The two primary ways I tend to approach dynamical systems reseach is through analytic analysis and simulations. Analytic techniques such as timescale analysis, perturbation theory, canard theory and others are powerful tools that can enable us to glean the underlying dynamics of often incredibly complicated systems. On the other hand, I tend to use simulations to *inform* and *verify* our analyic approximations, as well as conduct preliminary analysis of our system before any analytics are done. Combining these two approaches often leads to fruitful, fascinating results. 

## Data science 

What’s the point of theory if it doesn’t apply to the real world? The wealth of observational data and simulation data available to the science community allows us to conduct a litany of interesting science and discover correlations between seemingly uncorrelated physical events. 

# Climate physics projects

I explore the interests described above in my Ph. D. work, where I study climate physics. I am advised by [Prof. Cristi Proistosescu](https://cristi.web.illinois.edu/), where we are exploring two important themes related to climate change. 

## The physics of extreme heating events 
We are working to understand the arisal of heat waves and the basic physical mechanisms that lead to their occurance. Using conceptual models I’ve derived a 1D Hasselmann-like model for soil moisture dynamics with a analytically tractible nonlinearity. This model provides a novel uncoupling of the temperature and moisture dynamics near the surface. We intend to use this model to explore the moments of soil moisture near the surface when forced with stochastic precipitation, and map the moisture moments to temperature moments.  This in turn will enable us to understand how the temperature PDF evolves in a warming planet, hence giving us an understanding of extreme heating events. 

## The cost of climate change 
Secondly, we are collaborating with [Prof. Gernot Wagner](gwagner.com) to improve our understanding of the economic implications of climate change by upgrading the climate module in Gernot’s climate-economic program, [EZClimate](https://github.com/Litterman/EZClimate). We use a two-box climate emulator to capture the multiple timescales in climate warming that is neglected by most (if not all) climate-economic models. This project will result in an updated cost of carbon which can be of use to policymakers as laws such as carbon taxes are drafted. 

# Astrophysics projects 

** * I no longer work in this field. This section just serves as a bit of an “archive.”**

My first astrophysics project was supervised by [Prof. Brenda Frye](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye), Professor of astronomy at Steward Observatory. We studied the gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters using observational data, mainly spectroscopic and photometric. 

My second advisor was [Prof. Paul Carter](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~pcarter/index.html), Professor of mathematics now at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Together we proved the existence of transonic stellar wind solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, including viscosity and head conduction, totally rigorously using geometric singular perturbation theory. This was a highly enjoyable project. 

My third & final advisor at UArizona was [Prof. Sam Gralla](http://u.arizona.edu/~sgralla/). We worked on exploring the Aretakis instability near the inner horizon of black holes.

My final project was co-advised by [Prof. Nico Yunes](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/nyunes) and [Prof. Charles Gammie](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/gammie) (with great support from graduate student [Alejandro Cardenas-Avendano](https://alejandroc137.bitbucket.io/)). We used numerical and analytic models to ascertain that the Event Horizon Telescope can be used to test general relativity against modified gravity theories given sufficiently well-understood astrophysical modeling.
