# Project goal 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently advised in their sixth assessment report (AR6) to weight model projections of global temperature change by their ability to reproduce historical warming. While it is clear that this improves projections of global temperature change, it is unclear if this weighting scheme is useful for other projections, such as precipitation or regional temperature change. We're analyzing the skill of the IPCC's weighting scheme in projections of other climate variables to address this ambiguity.
