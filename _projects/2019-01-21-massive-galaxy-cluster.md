# Project goal 
We use spectroscopy data from Gemini/GMOS to investigate the dynamics of a massive galaxy cluster, G165. We also use measured spectroscopic redshifts to constrain gravitational lens models.

# Abstract
We present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3-IR imaging in the fields of six apparently bright dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at _z_ = 2-4 identified by their rest-frame far-infrared colors using the Planck and Herschel space facilities. We detect near-infrared counterparts for all six submillimeter sources, allowing us to undertake strong-lensing analyses. One field in particular stands out for its prominent giant arcs, PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165). After combining the color and morphological information, we identify 11 sets of image multiplicities in this one field. We construct a strong-lensing model constrained by this lensing evidence, which uncovers a bimodal spatial mass distribution, and from which we measure a mass of (2.6 &plusmn; 0.11) &times; 10<sup>14</sup> solar masses within ~250 kpc. The bright (_S_<sub>350</sub> &asymp; 750 mJy) DSFG appears as two images: a giant arc with a spatial extent of 4.5'' that is merging with the critical curve, and a lower-magnification counterimage that is detected in our new longer-wavelength ground- and space-based imaging data. Using our ground-based spectroscopy, we calculate a dynamical mass of 1.3<sub>-0.70</sub><sup>+0.04</sup> &times; 10<sup>15</sup> solar masses to the same fixed radius, although this value may be inflated relative to the true value if the velocity distribution is enhanced in the line-of-sight direction. We suggest that the bimodal mass taken in combination with the weak X-ray flux and low SZ decrement may be explained as a pre-merger for which the intracluster gas is diluted along the line of sight, while the integrated surface mass density is supercritical to strong-lensing effects.
