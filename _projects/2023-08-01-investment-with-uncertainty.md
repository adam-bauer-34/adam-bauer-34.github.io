# Project goal 
Most state-of-the-art climate-economic models assume a frictionless economy as it pertains to greenhouse gas emissions abatement; this is to say, as soon as policymakers spend money on abating fossil fuel emissions, such emissions reductions manifest as soon as the check clears. In the real world, however, the economy possesses significant inertia that slows the deployment of new technologies, including fossil fuel abatement capital stocks, regardless on how much is spent by policymakers. This inertia generally calls for a more agressive near-term financial approach relative to the no intertia case, as there is a (often significant) time lag between spending and abatement. The goal of this project is to augment a model which captures economic inertia with a systematic treatement of climate unceratinty; we hypothesize that the effects of climate risk and economic inertia will compound, resulting in an ambitious, near-term financial strategy if the Paris Agreement temperature targets are to be met.

I am very pleased to have been hired as a short-term consultant at the World Bank Climate Change Group while this work is being completed!

# Abstract
We develop a financial-economic model for carbon pricing with an explicit representation of decision making under risk and uncertainty that is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s sixth assessment report. We find that this approach provides economic support for the warming targets in the Paris Agreement across a variety of specifications. We show that risk associated with high damages in the long term leads to stringent mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions in the near term. Our results provide insight into how a systematic incorporation of climate-related risk influences 'optimal' emissions abatement pathways.
