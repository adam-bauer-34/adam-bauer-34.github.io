# Project goal 
We investigate the spacetime near null rays (i.e., light rays) by taking the Penrose limit of the relevant spacetime. We construct a "wormhole"-like structure in the Penrose limit spacetime. 

# Abstract
In this thesis, we investigate the various properties of null rays in the Schwarzschild and Reissner-N&ouml;rdstrom geometries. We first provide the general construction of the Penrose limit metric in an arbitrary spacetime. We then show that the Penrose limit metric for a general ingoing geodesicin the Schwarzschild geometry is flat. We further show a mathematical construction which extends null rays with _L_ = _E_ = 0 through the Schwarzschild singularity at _r_ = 0 via a "wormhole" structure. Also presented is the Penrose limit metric of the Schwarzschild event horizon, which is shown to be flat. We then use perturbation theory to derive a rate at which event horizon null generators escape/fall into the black hole in the Schwarzschild, non-extremal Reissner-N&ouml;rdstrom and extremal Reissner-N&ouml;rdstrom spacetimes.
