# Project goal 
We incorporate the findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report into the _Carbon Asset Pricing model -- AR6 (CAP6)_ financial asset pricing model that prices CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as an asset with negative returns. This framework includes an explicit representation of decision making under uncertainty and risk to be incorporated when considering 'optimal' abatement choices; put differently, in our model, policy can be made to 'hedge' against serious climate damages.

# Abstract
We develop a financial-economic model for carbon pricing with an explicit representation of decision making under risk and uncertainty that is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s sixth assessment report. We find that this approach provides economic support for the warming targets in the Paris Agreement across a variety of specifications. We show that risk associated with high damages in the long term leads to stringent mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions in the near term. Our results provide insight into how a systematic incorporation of climate-related risk influences 'optimal' emissions abatement pathways.
