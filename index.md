I am a physics Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Cristian Proistosescu](https://cristi.web.illinois.edu/). I am working to make advancements in the field of climate physics both in fundamental theory and its implications for economic, human, and ecological wellbeing.

**Announcements:** My last ever paper in astrophysics was just posted to arXiv (and is in revision for publication)! Check it out here: [*Spherical accretion in alternative theories of gravity*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02178)

Here are some quick links:
